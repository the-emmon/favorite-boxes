| ------------- | ------------- |------ | ---|--|
| Feline |     Linux| HackTheBox | Hard | This one is a pivoting joyride. Tunnel like the weird little mole you are. |
| Proper| Windows | HackTheBox | Hard | Brilliant. Totally realistic, yet so creative and challenging. One port open. |
| Nukem | Linux | PG Practice | Hard | The best privesc I've ever encountered, and certainly the funniest. | 
| Sharp | Windows | HackTheBox | Hard | Getting administrator is an elaboration on how you got user. Very well-planned and coherent.|
| Potato | Linux | PG Play | Easy | I learned a couple tricks from this potato. Easy, educational carbohydrates - what's not to love? |
| Zero | Windows | CyberSecLabs| 2/10 | Not what I expected to find. |
